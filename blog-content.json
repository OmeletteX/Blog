          "content": "It was the 7th of August, 2023, a day that marked the beginning of my dedicated journey towards becoming a skilled software engineer. My programming journey commenced back in 2019, with tutorials on Python and JavaScript. Fast forward to 2021, I enrolled in a university course on Python fundamentals and data analytics, which provided me a solid grasp of object-oriented programming. Additionally, I recently completed NandtoTetris Part 1, delving into the intricate workings of computers. This course, undertaken by NTU students in their first year, proved to be one of the most challenging experiences I've encountered. In the realm of design, I also ventured into Google's UX design certification, courtesy of a free Coursera account from my school. While insightful, I couldn't help but notice the contrasting difficulty level between technological and design courses. Designers, I dare say, seem to have it easier.\n\nNow, after a year-long hiatus and equipped with a bachelor's degree in accounting, I've made the resolute decision to embrace this journey wholeheartedly."
