          "content": "7th August 2023, the day I put everything aside and start on my journey to become a software engineer. I started learning programming from 2019, doing tutorials on Python, JavaScript. Then in 2021, I took a university course on Python fundamentals and Python for data analytics which brings me up to understanding object-oriented programming.. Also recently I completed NandtoTetris P1 as I am curious on how a computer was made. Probably one of the toughest course I have ever seen, and NTU students have to go through it in their year 1. Also, I  went on to finish the first couse of Google UX design cert as my school gave me a free cousera account. Babys work compared to any technological courses out there. Designers got it easy i have to say. \n\n Alas, after a year break, graduating from university with a bachelor in accounting, I decided it is time to finally take this seriously."

I also stimulated my interest, and I think I have what it takes to be a great programmer. I also started building the backbone of this blog, using codes from ChatGPT. I already have an idea of how HTML and CSS work. Now I am learning JavaScript, and I will be adding more features to this blog post as time goes by."
