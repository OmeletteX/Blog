This review enabled me to comprehend the specific functions associated with each webpage element. I encountered a challenge while aligning the containers at the center of the page. Whenever I increased the container width, the right side expanded, causing the container to tilt to the right. I realized that I needed to apply a margin-left attribute to the container's CSS class. This experience also underscored the importance of understanding the precedence of CSS styles. Integrating additional effects into pre-existing code created by others led to overlapping styles, necessitating meticulous sorting. Through a line-by-line examination, I resolved these issues and deepened my understanding of the code's significance.",

My programming journey commenced back in 2019, with tutorials on Python and JavaScript. Fast forward to 2021, I enrolled in a university course on Python fundamentals and data analytics, which provided me a solid grasp of object-oriented programming. Additionally, I recently completed NandtoTetris Part 1, delving into the intricate workings of computers. This course, undertaken by NTU students in their first year, proved to be one of the most challenging experiences I've encountered. In the realm of design, I also ventured into Google's UX design certification, courtesy of a free Coursera account from my school. While insightful, I couldn't help but notice the contrasting difficulty level between technological and design courses. Designers, I dare say, seem to have it easier. Now, after a year-long hiatus and equipped with a bachelor's degree in accounting, I've made the resolute decision to embrace this journey wholeheartedly."
